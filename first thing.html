MCL is an online Minecraft community where we hold monthly tournaments in an arcade style fashion. It is usually played in 10 teams of 4 and it is all for fun. Teams are randomly set unless you specify who you want to be teamed with. We play 8 different gamemodes that are both team based and skill based. We also hold events for testing of something new and in development.

    Ranks
</h2>
<p class="what"> 
Ranks are <strong> Do Not</strong> give any advantage in the tournaments what so ever. They are purely for cosmetic purposes during the tournament.  Of course, these cosmetics come at a cost. Ranks are a way for the community to support the creators and keep the tournaments going with an incentive given to the supporter. The rank will display a tag next to your in-game name during our events. Depending on the rank package you buy, more custommization will be available such as join/leave messages, your text color, tag color and much more.
